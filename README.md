## sphinx-gradle-plugin

`sphinx-gradle-plugin` is a [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) plugin that uses [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/)
to generate a project web site or documentation.

Sphinx itself was originally created by the Python community for the new Python documentation. It uses
a plaintext format called [reStructured Text](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html)
which it then compiles into a variety of documentation formats such as HTML, LaTeX (for PDF) and ePub.
reStructured Text is similar to [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) but - at least via
Sphinx - has better support for multi-page documentation.
