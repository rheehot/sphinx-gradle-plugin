sphinx-gradle-plugin
====================
*sphinx-gradle-plugin* is a `Gradle`_ plugin that uses `Sphinx`_ to generate a project web site or
documentation.

Sphinx itself was originally created by the Python community for the new Python documentation. It uses
a plaintext format called `reStructured Text`_ which it then compiles into a variety of documentation formats
such as HTML, LaTeX (for PDF) and ePub. reStructured Text is similar to `Markdown`_ but - at least via Sphinx -
has better support for multi-page documentation.

Extensions
----------
This plugin provides the following additional extensions out of the box:

- `sphinxcontrib-httpdomain`_ - Sphinx domain for documenting HTTP APIs
- `sphinxcontrib-plantuml`_ - enables embedding `PlantUML`_ diagrams
- `sphinxcontrib-inlinesyntaxhighlight`_ - enables syntax-highlighting inline literals
- `recommonmark`_ - adds Markdown support
- `javasphinx`_ - adds the Java domain

Themes
------
This plugin provides the following additional themes out of the box:

- `guzzle_sphinx_theme <https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle_sphinx_theme>`_
- `sphinx_bootstrap_theme <http://ryan-roemer.github.io/sphinx-bootstrap-theme/>`_
- `sphinx_rtd_theme <https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_

Changelog
---------
See `the GitHub releases page <https://github.com/trustin/sphinx-gradle-plugin/releases>`_.

Credits
-------
This plugin reuses the ``SphinxRunner`` implementation of ``sphinx-maven-plugin`` originally written by
`Thomas Dudziak`_. `Bala Sridhar`_ since then upgraded Sphinx to 1.3.1 and added PlantUML and JavaSphinx
support in his fork. I'd like to appreciate their effort that did all the heavy lifting.
